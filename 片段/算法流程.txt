\par Cellular automata is a model that defines \textbf{a finite space} and a series of \textbf{discrete cells}. These cells will automatically evolve according to the different states of their eight \textbf{neighbors} and follow certain \textbf{evolution rules}. It is a dynamic and discrete system which can simulate the growth, decomposition and competition of various fungi on the wood very well. Fig.(\ref{f1ForCA}) shows a brief sketch of cellular automata model.

\par Fig.(\ref{AS}) is the \textbf{evolution rules} for the fungi cell. In the whole process, the growth speed of the cell follows the modified extension rate which is shown on Eqn.\eqref{???}, the winning probability is defined by Elo rating system which is shown on Eqn.\eqref{???} and the decomposition rate is calculated by Eqn.\eqref{???}.
